# StudyBox
The StudyBox is meant to encourage healthy habits and combat the distractions that social media poses on youths today, we aim to create a device that stimulates focus toward productive activities and helps young people to achieve their academic and personal goals. The deliberate design of addictive social media has harmed many teenagers’ and children’s attention span, self-esteem, and mental development. Thus it is essential that devices exist to counter this modern phenomenon. Our solution to this problem is to create a StudyBox, which is basically a container that can store a “reward” (i.e. phone, cookies, etc.). After a certain amount of time that is set by the user expires, the StudyBox will automatically open, revealing the “reward” inside that they can take. The purpose of this is to utilize the concept of ‘positive reinforcement’ to increase their motivation to completely focus on studying for set periods of time which would ultimately increase their productivity and efficiency with their time.
