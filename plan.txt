    - If timer > 3600 (1 hour), reset timer = 0 and indicate so through sound and lights
2. Press button_b to start the countdown
    - Lights start green then gradually to yellow, then to red as timer decreases
        - Create ratio = (defaultBrightness / timer), to be used to add/subtract red and green every second

3. Once timer expires, activate servo motor, lights, and if the switch is on, play song
